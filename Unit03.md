**Unit 3: Campaigns: Candidates, Strategies, and Money** <span
id="3"></span> 
*In Unit 1, you gained a basic understanding of elections; in this unit,
you will learn about campaigns.  This unit will first focus on
candidates, asking: “Who runs for office and why?”  This unit will
examine campaign organization and discuss different strategies for
targeting voters and getting elected.  Some candidates look to engage
the masses and attract a grassroots following, while others seek
approval from party elites or other popular elected officials to try to
attract votes.  Regardless of the approach, you will learn that
candidates must consider their campaign strategies very carefully in
order to have a successful day at the polls.  Finally, you will learn
about the important role that money plays in American campaigns.  Money
has influenced campaigns in the United States for more than a century,
which has led to various government interventions and responses.  For
example, you will learn the steps the government has taken to prevent
money from making the electoral system undemocratic and the impact that
these laws have had on campaigns*.
