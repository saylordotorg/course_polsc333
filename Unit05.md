**Unit 5: Campaigns and the Media** <span id="5"></span> 
*Another important component of the campaign and election process is the
media.  The media plays a major role in shaping and defining the message
that a given candidate communicates in a given election.  The media also
ensures that citizens have access to information about candidates and
elections.  However, note the give-and-take relationship between
politicians and media; their codependence can impact how we perceive
politicians.  In this unit, you will learn how candidates use the media
and how the media covers politicians. *
