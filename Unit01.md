id="1"></span> 
*This unit will provide you with a basic understanding of the purpose of
elections, the various types of elections that exist, voting rights, and
the rules that govern elections in the United States.  Subunit 1.1 will
focus on explaining the purpose of elections in the American political
system.  You will learn about the historic significance of
representation and citizenship and the right to vote in the United
States.  Although the principle of representative democracy existed in
colonial America, it took a long time for all citizens to earn the right
to vote and have their voices heard by the government.  In subunit 1.2,
you will gain a general sense of the various types of elections in the
United States and the role that citizens play in the process.  Finally,
this unit will conclude with a discussion on how elections are run in
the United States and how electoral outcomes can be shaped by
redistricting.  By the end of this unit, you should have a strong sense
of the role that elections play in the United States.*
