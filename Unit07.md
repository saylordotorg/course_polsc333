**Unit 7: Electoral Reform** <span id="7"></span> 
*No electoral system is without flaws; the United States has seen (and
will continue to see) a number of electoral reforms designed to rectify
its “imperfect” system.  Some of these changes were obvious “quick
fixes” to clearly undemocratic practices.  Others are less obvious and
tend to spark a great deal of debate within the public policy arena.  In
this unit, you will first look at some of the electoral changes that
have been enacted historically.  Many of these changes were implemented
with the intention of developing a more open and democratic political
system.  However, many still feel that reforms are necessary; reforms
are constantly proposed and debated in the public arena and within
government.  In the second half of this unit, you will take a closer
look at some of these proposed reforms and their potential for
implementation.  By the end of this unit, you should be aware that the
American electoral system, like all electoral systems, is not perfect
and that reform will continue to be an ongoing debate.*

    Amendment has gained traction among many conservative groups.  The
    argument in favor of repeal is that it would increase the power of
    the states in the political process and have elected officials who,
    presumably, would care primarily about the state’s interest over the
    “corrupting” influence of wealthy corporate donors.  Do you agree
    with this position?  Why, or why not?
