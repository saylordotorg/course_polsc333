**Unit 6: Election Outcomes** <span id="6"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn how election outcomes impact government
actions and public policy.  Although elections often have immediate
political consequences, the American political system is designed so
major changes happen slowly.  Although the majority party often has more
power in terms of shaping public policy than does the minority party,
the design of the American political system (i.e., checks and balances,
separation of powers) ensures that party dominance in the legislative
branch does not mean that a given party has free rein in implementing
public policy. *  
    
 *This unit will address important electoral outcomes and assess the
impact that these outcomes have on the legislative process.  You will
learn how party dominance can change (realignment), how political
parties can enjoy a sense of power after winning a large majority in an
election (political mandate), how bipartisanship has changed (or
disappeared) over time, and how all this can impact policy
implementation.*
