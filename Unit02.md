**Unit 2: Campaigns, Elections and Voting Behavior** <span
id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, you will take a look at one of the most important
components of the election process: the voters. You will first study the
internal and external factors that compel people to vote the way that
they do. You will then examine voter turnout trends over time and learn
how different types of elections and issues result in greater or lesser
voter turnout; for example, such high-profile elections as presidential
or gubernatorial elections tend to see greater turnout than local
elections for city council do.  Lastly, you will look at why people do
not vote as well as the issues that arise around voter
disenfranchisement and barriers to voting—either intentionally or
unintentionally—among certain groups.*
