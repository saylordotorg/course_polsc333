**Unit 4: Campaigns, Political Parties, and Interest Groups** <span
id="4"></span> 
*There are many factors that impact political campaigns in America.  In
this unit, you will learn how political parties and interest groups
shape the electoral landscape by influencing candidates and voters.  You
will first focus on the role of political parties in elections, learning
how parties have influenced elections in the past and in the present. 
You will also discover how the American political system maintains a
strong two-party system (i.e., a system of Democrats and Republicans)
and makes it difficult for a third party to gain prominence.  Next, you
will focus on interest groups, learning how they impact campaigns,
candidates, and voters.*
