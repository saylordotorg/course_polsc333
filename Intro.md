Course Syllabus for "POLSC333: Campaigns and Elections"
-------------------------------------------------------

Americans are known for their competitive nature.  Whether between two
sports teams on a field or between candidates in the political arena
running for office, competition is a fundamental part of the American
culture.  For this reason, campaigns and elections are among the most
exciting events in American politics.  In this course, you will explore
campaigns and elections, learning their purpose and significance and
observing the impact that they have on the American political system.
Unit 1 will provide you with a basic understanding of the American
electoral process by focusing on the history and evolution of elections
and voting laws in the United States.  Unit 2 will look closely at what
compels individuals to run for office and the many factors that must be
considered when launching a campaign: strategy, organization,
fundraising, themes, and messages.  In Unit 3, you will learn how
political parties and interest groups play into the political drama of
elections.  Units 4 and 5 will introduce you to the two remaining key
players in the electoral process: voters and the media.  In Unit 6, we
will take a closer look at electoral outcomes and the impact that
elections have on public policy after votes are counted.  Unit 7 will
examine what types of proposals or alternatives could be implemented to
improve or reform the electoral system.  By the end of this course, you
should have a deeper understanding of the role and impact of campaigns
and elections in the United States.

             - Sub-subunit 4.1.3 Assignment  
             - Sub-subunit 4.2.3 Assignment

 However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the assignments listed above.

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **113
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should
help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 11 hours.  Perhaps you
